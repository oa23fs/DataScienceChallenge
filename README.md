We went through this project step by step and in our main file commented and labelled each step of the process using Markdown, this is the structure of our repository. 
Also included in our repository are the original CSV file and our 4 visualizations produced by our code

Step 2: Data Exploration 
1. Load the dataset
2. Explore data structure and types
3. Identify data quality issues
4. Document findings

Step 3: Data Cleaning  (make sure you record and present your assumptions and decisions)
1. Handle missing values
2. Fix data type issues
3. Address inconsistencies
4. Validate cleaned data
Note: Students must decide:
- Missing Values are resent in most datasets (5-10% of certain columns). Students must decide: fill, drop, or impute?
- Inconsistent Formats such as Hospital data has 'M', 'F', 'Male', 'Female'. Students must standardize
-  Invalid Data example, Age = -1 in some records. Students must identify and remove
- Data Type Issues examples, Dates could be stored as strings and not datetime objs, Numbers could be stored as objects. Students must convert appropriately
-  Outliers. Some datasets include realistic outliers. Students must decide how to handle

Step 4: Analysis 
1. Answer each of the 6 questions assigned to your team.
2. Perform statistical analysis
3. Create calculated metrics
4. Document insights

Step 5: Visualization
1. Create 4 meaningful visualizations
2. Add proper labels and titles
3. Save plots
4. Interpret results
